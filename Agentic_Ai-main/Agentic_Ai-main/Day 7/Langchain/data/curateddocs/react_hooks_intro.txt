React Hooks are functions that let you use React state and lifecycle features in functional components.

useState is the most basic hook to manage local state.
useEffect runs side effects after rendering, similar to componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate.

useMemo and useCallback help optimize performance by memoizing values and functions.
Hooks like useContext and useReducer enable shared state and complex state logic respectively.
