In this video, we explore React Hooks like useState and useEffect. 
These let you use state and side effects in functional components. 
We also demonstrate memoization using useMemo to optimize performance in rendering large lists.

By the end, you'll understand how to manage state without writing class components, 
and how hooks like useContext and useReducer help build scalable apps.
