[Dev_A] I think building modular agents using LangChain is better than chaining prompts manually.
[Dev_B] Agree. You can combine skill extractors, memory, and tools like FAISS in a flow.
[Dev_C] I made a flow to extract AI concepts from YouTube videos and recommend learning materials based on it.
[Dev_D] You should check LangGraph if you want structured control over agent steps.
